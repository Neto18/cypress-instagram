On this example I'm using some sort of POM for the login and log out
but I'm not trying to use POM for all the specs / tests, that's why
even when I have the selectors defined in the page objects, I'm not 
creating methods for every action, instead, I'm doing regular Cypress 
tests, and using the selectors created in the page objects.
